/**
 * Manages a queue of Utterances that are read in order by a screen reader.  This queue typically reads
 * things in a first-in-first-out manner, but it is possible to send an alert directly to the front of
 * the queue.  Items in the queue are sent to the screen reader front to back, driven by AXON/timer.
 *
 * Screen readers are inconsistent in the way that they order alerts, some use last-in-first-out order,
 * others use first-in-first-out order, others just read the last alert that was provided. This queue
 * manages order and improves consistency.
 *
 * NOTE: utteranceQueue is a type but instantiated and returned as a singleton.  It is initialized by Sim.js and if
 * something adds an alert to the queue before Sim.js has initialized the queue, the result will be a silent no-op.
